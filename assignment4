Question 1
By how many ways we can access elements in the DOM and write about them in brief?
Ans.
a) Accessing Elements by ID:-The easiest way to access a single element in the DOM is by its unique ID. 
We can grab an element by ID with the getElementById() method of the document object.
document.getElementById();

b)Accessing Elements by Class:-The class attribute is used to access one or more specific elements in the DOM.
We can get all the elements with a given class name with the getElementsByClassName() method.
document.getElementsByClassName();

c)Accessing Elements by Tag:-A less specific way to access multiple elements on the page would be by its HTML tag name.
We access an element by tag with the getElementsByTagName() method.
document.getElementsByTagName();

d)Query Selectors:- through this we can select ids,classes,tags.
document.querySelector();
document.querySelectorAll();
